INAF U6614: Data Analysis for Policy Research Using R

Final Project - Manisha, Shawn, Sharif

Instructions:
- The R Markdown can be run using 'Final Dataset.RData' - all of the code for this is set up.
- To reproduce our findings, please first run both of the two data management R Scripts (in any order): 
	1_Data_Management_Budget 
	1_Data_Management_Other
- Then, run 2_Analysis_regressions which produces 'Final Dataset.RData' for the R Markdown.
