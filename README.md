Thank you for coming to my GitHub! In this repository you'll find a sample of my latest programming project. 

**Python**
- Course: SIPA class, Text as Data (U6514) and Building AI Tools with Large Language Models (U6547)
- Date: May 2024
- Project: Large-language model orchestration with the World Bank API. 
- Motivation: Creating a workflow for receiving policy recommendations from a simple user prompt. 
- Key tasks: Analysing a user's prompt to derive parameters of interest (sectors, countries, and years) to query the World Bank API. Utilizing a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) approach, GPT 4.0 summarises relevant documents from the World Bank database to give policy recommendations for the parameters of interest. The summaries refer to specific sources, summarising each document, and give overall summaries of all documents. 

**Python**
- Course: SIPA class, Python for Public Policy (U6504)
- Date: April 2023
- Project: Examine how trends in New York City gentrification may (or may not) overlap with arrests
- Key tasks: Geocoding, Geospatial intersection and analysis of points and polygons (geopandas), data cleaning and analysis (pandas), data visualisation (geoplot, ggplot, plotly), linear regressions. 
- Research outcomes: Relationship between Gentrification and arrests over time was not statistically significant at the borough-level. However, there were distinct pockets within Brooklyn (e.g., Bushwick) where there was a strong relationship and elsewhere in Harlem this was not the case. This could benefit from further research to understand differentiated nature of crimes reported, crime enforcement, and other factors between these two areas.

**R**
- Course: SIPA class, Data Analysis for Policy Research Using R (U6614)
- Date: December 2023
- Project: 'Tackling the world's lowest fertility rate: Effect of childcare subsidies on birth-rate in South Korea.' Group project with Shawn Lee (MIA '24) and Manisha Swain (MPA '24). 
- Key tasks: Regressions (linear OLS, two-way fixed effects, panelr), knitting into PDFs and Presentations (Markdown), data cleaning, transformations, and visualisations (tidyverse, ggplot). 
- Research outcomes: Childcare subsidies (supply-side) did not result in a significant change to the already-declining birth rates in South Korea. This is evidenced by the government's switch to a policy of direct cash to parents (demand-side) in 2023. 

**R**
- Course: SIPA class, Text as Data (U6614)
- Date: February 2024
- Project: Text analysis of Jan 6th 2021 coverage.
- Key tasks: Tokenisation, document feature matrix, co-occurences, Zipf law, web scraping, cosine similarity (quanteda, tidyverse, ggcorrplot). 
- Research outcomes: Analysis of transcripts from CNN and Fox News highlights a discoursive difference, particularly around the term 'insurrection' which was more widely used by the former. 

**STATA**
- Course: SIPA class, Advanced Economic Development (U8145)
- Date: February 2024
- Project: Problem set on measures of development and theories of convergence. 
- Key tasks: For loops with regressions and local memory, matrices constructed with counter variables for regressions, complex twoway scatter graphs, generate and variable, sort/rank/list for min/max values
- Research outcomes: Non-GDP indicators of development are evaluated to be relevant for consideration, as demonstrated by the mismatch between income and Human Development Index in many countries. Moreover, the macroeconomic evidence suggests a lack of absolute convergence between Global South and North, even in the more optimistic post-2000 period.
