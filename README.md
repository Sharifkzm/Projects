Thank you for coming by my Github! Here you'll find a sample of my latest programming project. 

**Python**
- Course: SIPA class, Python for Public Policy (U6504)
- Date: April 2023
- Project: Examine how trends in New York City gentrification may (or may not) overlap with arrests
- Key tasks: Geocoding, Geospatial intersection and analysis of points and polygons (geopandas), data cleaning and analysis (pandas), data visualisation (geoplot, ggplot, plotly), linear regressions, 
- Research outcomes: Relationship between Gentrification and arrests over time was not statistically significant at the borough-level. However, there were distinct pockets within Brooklyn (e.g., Bushwick) where there was a strong relationship and elsewhere in Harlem this was not the case. This could benefit from further research to understand differentiated nature of crimes reported, crime enforcement, and other factors between these two areas. 

**R**
- Course: SIPA class, Data Analysis for Policy Research Using R (U6614)
- Date: December 2023
- Project: 'Tackling the world's lowest fertility rate: Effect of childcare subsidies on birth-rate in South Korea.' Group project with Shawn Lee and Manisha Swain. 
- Key tasks: Regressions (linear OLS, two-way fixed effects), knitting into PDFs and Presentations (Markdown), data cleaning, transformations, and visualisations (tidyverse, ggplot). 
- Research outcomes: Childcare subsidies (supply-side) did not result in a significant change to the already-declining birth rates in South Korea. This is evidenced by the government's switch to a policy of direct cash to parents (demand-side) in 2023.
