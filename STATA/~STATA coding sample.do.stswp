// ANSWER TO 1.5: The log graph is simpler to interpret and to see the differences between methodologies, with countries typically being undervalued in GDP/capita for USD relative to PPP. This is more clearly seen in a log chart that normalises for the various GDP/capita values that can be observed, enabling easier distinction and little clustering. 

// 1.6. Modify the graph command for 1.5 in two ways:
//(a) Have it draw a line indicating where the points would be if GDP/capita (exchange rate conversion) were exactly equal to GDP/capita (PPP conversion.) This is what we would ordinarily refer to as a 45-degree line, if  the scales on the x and y-axes were symmetric. (Hint: You can just include the x-axis variable as an additional yaxis variable, i.e. "graph twoway scatter lgdp_id lgdp_usd lgdp_usd, msymbol(oh) connect(i l) â€¦" where lgdp_id and lgdp_usd refer to log GDP/capita with PPP conversion and XR conversion respectively.

// 1.8. Based on your graph from 1.6, what generalization can you make about the relationship between how rich a  country is and the relative magnitudes of GDP/capita (PPP conversion) and GDP/capita (XR conversion)? What is an economic reason for this pattern?

// ANSWER TO 1.8: The richer a country is, the relative magnitudes of GDP/capita in PPP and XR align more closely and have smaller relative differences. This is likely because richer countries might have higher cost of services within their countries, driven by higher wages from the higher productivity economies, and thus their currency's purchasing power for services does not have a large difference with purchasing power for tradable goods. 

*** Question 2: Comparing GDP/capita with other development indicators

// 2.4. Write a short paragraph (i.e. 2-3 sentences) using your graphs from part 2.2 and 2.3 as evidence in support of the assertion by Robert Lucas in the quote at the beginning of Chapter 2 of Ray (see also Ray's discussion on  p. 9) that average per capita income is a reasonable way to measure economic development. Next write a short paragraph using your graphs as evidence against Lucas' argument. Finally, write a sentence or two expressing your own view about whether GDP/capita is a reasonable measure of development

// ANSWER TO 2.5: 2.2 demonstrates a negative association between GDP/capita and infant mortlity, whilst adult literacy has a positive association with GDP/capita. These two findings support the notion that increasing GDP/capita improves development as both infant mortality and adult literacy are core components of human capabilities, the improvement of which is tied to an increasing GDP/capita. That being said, we have plotted a linear regression line whilst the rate of returns of GDP/capita for these measures of development seem to be diminishing. Therefore, GDP/capita cannot measure economic development past a certain point. My own opinion is similar to the counter argument: there are significant drivers of development which seem to be associated with GDP/capita but this relationship breaks down with increasing GDP/capita. Moreover, there are many instances of strong public services tackling infant mortality and adult literacy without subsequently raising GDP/capita - therefore, this association is not necessarily indicative of a causal relationship between GDP/capita and key measures of development. 


// Question 3: Comparing the Human Development Index with GDP/capita

clear 

use ps1data_2.dta

// 3.1. Create a new variable, hdi, representing the Human Development Index (HDI) for each of the 167  countries. Refer to the notes from lecture and to the technical notes to the Human Development Report 2016  here: http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2016_technical_notes.pdf. Use the goalposts reported in the  Technical Notes for the 2016 report. (Note that your HDI will not match exactly the HDI published in the  report, since the data you are using is from 2008, not 2016. Note also that you should first re-define any  variables that are above the maximum goalpost or below the minimum one. The Stata syntax for value above the maximum is "replace varname = max_goalpost if varname>max_goalpost & varname~=."

// Scoping the tasks at hand-hand:

// 1. Construct indices for life expectancy, log GNI per capita, mean years schooling, expected years schooling

// 3.4. What generalizations can you draw about these three groups: countries with poor HDI relative to  GDP/capita, countries with good HDI relative to GDP/capita, and countries with both poor HDI and low  GDP/capita? (Note: no single right answer here. Hint: a useful exercise is to calculate the difference in HDI  rank vs. GDP/capita rank for each country, subtracting one from the other. Which countries tend to have large  positive differences? Which countries tend to have large negative differences?)

// ANSWER TO 3.4: Countries with higher HDI:GDPPC likely exhibit greater development metrics such as life expectancy and education, whilst having lower average income (GDPPC). These nations can be expected to have a higher and/or more effective investment in public services that distributes key development benefits to the population, whilst economic activity may not be productive enough to generate high income/GDPPC in relative terms. For the converse, countries with a lower HDI:GDPPC enjoy a higher 'average' income level (as defined by GDPPC) but these benefits are not translating to greater development indicators for a number of reasons. These could be due to poorer government provisions or an inequitable distribution of the income which is generated. For example, Ukraine and Georgia benefit from raw resource exports but their economies are characterised by high corruption which limits the redistribution of the generated income.

// 4.5. Another way of evaluating whether there was absolute convergence in the world economy is to run a regression of growth rates on initial income levels. Usually log initial income (using the natural logarithm, ln) is used as the right-hand-side variable. The syntax for running a regression of y on x in Stata is: "reg y x". (This includes an  intercept, which you should also do in this problem.) Run regressions of (a) the growth rate from 1960-1999 on log  income in 1960, and (b) the growth rate from 2000-2019 on log income in 2000. Cut and paste the Stata output into your write-up. (You do not need to make a nice-looking table.) Recall from your statistics classes that a regression coefficient is typically considered statistically significant if the t-statistic is above 1.96 and the p-value is below 0.05 (which are equivalent statements in this context).

// 4.6. How do you interpret your graphs from Questions 4.3-4.4 and your regressions from Question 4.5? Is there evidence of absolute convergence in the world economy from 1960-1999? Is there evidence of absolute convergence from 2000-2019? Explain in a few sentences. 

// ANSWER TO 4.6: First interpreting the regressions, we have a level-log so we can see that for a 1% increase in the GDPPC in 1960 the growth rate increased by 0.001% on average. For the latter period, however, a 1% increase in GDPPC in 2000 was associated with an decrease of 0.005% in the growth rate on average. This implies that  convergence occured more in the latter period than the earlier period. Both results are statistically significant at the 5% level. These results are supported by charts in 4.3-4.4 which show a positive correlation between starting GDPPC and growth in 1960-99 but a negative correlation in 2000-2019. That being said, the correlation is not very strong and there seems to be very high variance for poorer countries - and we are only including one variable so we are likely suffering from omitted variable bias. Therefore, we cannot take the results of the regression at face-value to be representative of all countries and thus not an indication of absolute convergence (which requiers all developing countries catching up with developed countries in terms of per capita output) in either period. There are many countries on the chart in 4.4 (the more optimistic period for the convergence argument) which started off with a low GDPPC but experienced negative or stagnant growth during those 20 years. Therefore, with many countries still lagging in growth rate despite their starting points, we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude there is absolute convergence in the world economy as per the Solow model definition but there may be conditional convergance.
